This respository is intended to help me to write things and help me to demonstrate them writing proofs of concepts.

## Kubernetes Infrastructure Over LXC
The First thing I wrote is a deployment of [Deploy a Kubernetes infrastructure over LXC](KubernetesOnLxcAnsible/README.md)

It is a simple way to deploy a Kubernetes infrastructure using LXC to create "some kind of" Virtual Machines. This saves some RAM, CPU and Disk compared to real Virtual Machines.

However, you must know this is not for production but for self training or making some demo.
